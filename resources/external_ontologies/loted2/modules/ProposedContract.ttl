Given that in 2007 the CPV codes have been changed, the difference between the 'CPV code' and the 'original CPV code' is that the second one indicates the CPV code assigned to the products, service, works by the contracting authority/entity and chosen in the list of not updated CPV codes.

The Publications Office of the European Union, modifies the 'original CPV code' with the updated one (in the LOTED2 ontology expressed through data-type property LOTED2: CPVcode).

Therefore the search through CPV code on Tenders Electronic Daily website will always be based on the value assigned by the Publications Office (not according to the 'original CPV value'). 

The contracting authority/entity is informed by the Publications Office of the modification of the 'original CPV code'. 

'The aim of the CPV is to standardise, by means of a single classification system for public procurement, the terms used by contracting authorities and entities to describe the subject of contracts, by offering an appropriate tool to potential users (contracting entities/authorities, candidates or tenderers in contract award procedure). The use of standard codes makes it easier to implement the advertising rules and facilitates access to information, thereby: 
- boosting transparency in public procurement; 
- making it easier to identify business opportunities published in the supplement to the Official Journal of the European Union; 
- making it possible to set up an information system for public procurement and reduce the risk of error in translating notices, since the CPV is translated into 22 official languages of the European Communities; 
- simplifying the task of drafting notices, and in particular describing the subject matter of contracts, for contracting authorities and contracting entities; 
- simplifying the drafting of statistics on public procurement, since the CPV is compatible with trade monitors used throughout the world (especially those used by the United Nations)' (Source: Guide to Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) available at: http://simap.europa.eu/codes-and-nomenclatures/codes-cpv/cpv_2008_guide_en.pdf)."""@en ;

If in the GoodRelations ontology the data-type property gr: hasMaxCurrencyValue 'specifies the UPPER BOUND of the amount of money for a price RANGE per unit, shipping charges, or payment charges' (source GoodRelations annotation to gr: hasMaxCurrencyValue) in the LOTED2 ontology the property LOTED2:hasCurrencyEstimatedValue specifies the UPPER BOUND of the amount of estimated money for a price RANGE per public procurement contract. 

The main difference between these two properties expressed in the two ontologies, is that in the case of a public contract, the price will be determined at the end of the tender (i.e. the competition). 

In fact, at the time of publication of the notice, it will only an 'estimated value'; the real price of the contract, i.e. the amount of money that will be paid by the contracting authority/entity for the service, work or supply, will be determined at the end of the tender, by the winning tender offer (the offer with the lower price or the most economically advantageous offer).

Offers to be presented will be based on this estimated value, which is usually what the administration believes it would cost the work, service, supply concerned. 
This estimated value is also a relevant reference for checking of abnormally low tenders (please see art. 55 Directive 2004/18/EC and art. 57 Directive 2004/17/EC) because if, for a given contract, tenders appear to be abnormally low in relation to the goods, works or services, the contracting authority/entity shall, before it may reject those tenders, request in writing details of the constituent elements of the tender which it considers relevant. 

Like in GoodRelations:

- in LOTED2 ontology it is possibile to define price information as intervals. If this is needed, use LOTED2:hasMaxCurrencyEstimatedValue for the upper bound and LOTED2:hasMinCurrencyEstimatedValue for the lower bound;

The main difference between this class and the gr: PriceSpecification, is that in the case of a public contract, the price will be determined at the end of the tender (i.e. race). 

In fact, at the time of publication of the notice, it will only an 'estimated value'; the real price of the contract, i.e. the amount of money that will be paid by the contracting authority/entity for the service, work or supply, will be determined at the end of the tender, by the successsful tender offer (the offer with the lower price or the most economically advantageous one).

Offers to be presented will be based on this estimated value, which is usually what the administration believes it would cost the work, service, supply concerned. This means the price basis auction. 

This estimated value is also a relevant reference for checking of abnormally low tenders (please see art. 55 Directive 2004/18/EC and art. 57 Directive 2004/17/EC) because if, for a given contract, tenders appear to be abnormally low in relation to the goods, works or services, the contracting authority/entity shall, before it may reject those tenders, request in writing details of the constituent elements of the tender which it considers relevant. 

It is always defined excluding VAT, so this restiction is expressed asserting as necessary condition, namely: LOTED2:valueAddedTaxIncluded (data-type property with range xsd: boolean) value false."""@en ;

- if a proposed contract isDividedInLots (datatype property) has value false, then this contract has type ProposedContractNotDividedIntoLots.

Whereas there are also mixed contracts, the Directive 2004/18/EC states that:

\"A public contract having as its object the supply of products and which also covers, as an incidental matter, siting and installation operations shall be considered to be a ‘public supply contract’.\"
The notice does not indicate explicitly whether a contract is of mixed type, because the qualification of the contract (as services public contract) is made ​​by the awarding authority, before the publication of notice. 
For these reasons, a public supply contract is expressed in the ontology as a public contract that has at least one (some) Supply as ContractSubject (and not 'only')."""@en ;
