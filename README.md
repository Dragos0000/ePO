# eprocurementontology

## This repository  
### Role and main functions
The e-procurement ontology repository has been set up to support the collaborative work around the development of the e-procurement ontology. 
The repository should be used as issue tracker in each step of the development of the ontology. All the documents related to the project are stored on [Joinup](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/eprocurementontology/home).
The various parts for which the inputs of the working group are required are documented in this repository under the [wiki](https://github.com/eprocurementontology/eprocurementontology/wiki).  
This wiki should be used as an entry point to use the issue tracker such as creating a new issue or commenting an existing issue. The methodology to be followed to submit new issues is documented under each part of the wiki.
