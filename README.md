# eprocurementontology
The e-procurement ontology repository has been set up to support the collaborative work around the development of the e-procurement ontology. 
The repository should be used as issue tracker in each step of the development of the ontology. All the documents related to the project are stored on Joinup (link below). 
The various parts for which the inputs of the working group are required are documented in this repository under the tab "wiki" (above).
